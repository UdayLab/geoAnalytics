# Introduction

geoAnalytics is an open-source Python-based Machine Learning library developed to discover various forms of 
useful information hidden in the raster data. The algorithms provided in this library cover a wide-spectrum 
of machine learning tasks, such as imputation, image fusion, clustering, classification, one class 
classification, and pattern mining. This library being platform independent can run any operating system. 
Useful links to utilize the services of this library were provided below:

1. Youtube tutorial  

2. Tutorials (Notebooks)  
   
3. User manual 

4. Coders manual  

5. Code documentation 

6. Datasets  

7. [Discussions](https://github.com/UdayLab/geoAnalytics/discussions)

# Installing GDAL Package
`GDAL` is an important toolkit in our library. It is for converting the raster data in any format into a human readable text or CSV format.
We have present the methods to install this toolkit using Conda environment on a machine running Ubuntu operating system.


    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove

    sudo apt-get install -y cdo nco gdal-bin libgdal-dev
    
    
    pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/include/gdal" GDAL==`gdal-config --version`


    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    python -m pip install --upgrade gdal 

If the above two commands have failed to install gdal, then execute the following commands:

    conda install -c conda-forge libgdal
    conda install -c conda-forge gdal
    conda install tiledb=2.2
    conda install poppler

Once the above commands were executed, check the version information by typing the following command on the `terminal`:

    ogrinfo --version

***
# Maintenance

  __Installation__


         pip install geoAnalytics


  __Upgradation__

  
        pip install --upgrade geoAnalytics
  

  __Uninstallation__

  
        pip uninstall geoAnalytics 
       

  __Information__ 


        pip show geoAnalytics

***
# *Try your first geoAnalytics program*

```shell
$ python
```

```python
# first import pami 
from PAMI.frequentPattern.basic import FPGrowth as alg
fileURL = "https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/transactionalDatabases/Transactional_T10I4D100K.csv"
minSup=300
obj = alg.FPGrowth(iFile=fileURL, minSup=minSup, sep='\t')
#obj.mine()  #deprecated
obj.mine()
obj.save('frequentPatternsAtMinSupCount300.txt')
frequentPatternsDF= obj.getPatternsAsDataFrame()
print('Total No of patterns: ' + str(len(frequentPatternsDF))) #print the total number of patterns
print('Runtime: ' + str(obj.getRuntime())) #measure the runtime
print('Memory (RSS): ' + str(obj.getMemoryRSS()))
print('Memory (USS): ' + str(obj.getMemoryUSS()))
```

```
Output:
Frequent patterns were generated successfully using frequentPatternGrowth algorithm
Total No of patterns: 4540
Runtime: 8.749667644500732
Memory (RSS): 522911744
Memory (USS): 475353088
